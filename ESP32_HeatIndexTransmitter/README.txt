Device notifies phone of heat index every second.
DHT22 must be hooked up to pin 4 by default.
Use with nrfConnect app, must connect to device then look under "Unknown Service"
My DHT22 will often read bogus -1C value, might need to fix
Also need to implement sleep modes, might not be possible with Arduino IDE, may need to use ESP-IDF
